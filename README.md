# Fulmine: Forecasting Energy Consumption Demand in Industries

Welcome to Fulmine, a major project focused on forecasting energy consumption demand in industries. Our goal is to provide accurate and reliable predictions that can help businesses optimize their energy usage and reduce costs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Fulmine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fulmine.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd fulmine
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the tests:
   ```sh
   pytest tests/
   ```
5. Start the project:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
6. Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
7. To run the project in a Docker container, use the following command:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 5000:5000 your-username/fulmine:latest
   ```
8. To build and push the Docker image, use the following commands:
   ```sh
   docker build -t your-username/fulmine:latest .
   docker push your-username/fulmine:latest
   ```
9. To run the project in a Kubernetes cluster, use the following commands:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml -n fulmine-namespace && \
     kubectl expose deployment fulmine --port=5000 --name=fulmine-service --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \
     kubectl get services fulmine-service --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \
     echo "Web application is now accessible at http://<your-cluster-ip>:5000" && \
     kubectl get pods fulmine --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \
     echo "Fulmine pod(s) are running successfully." && \
     kubectl describe pod fulmine-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \
     echo "Fulmine pod(s) details are as follows:" && \
     kubectl get secrets fulmine-secrets --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \ \ echo "Fulmine secrets are as follows:" && \  kubectl get configmaps fulmine-configmaps --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \ \ echo "Fulmine config maps are as follows:" && \  kubectl get persistentvolumes fulmine-pv --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \ \ echo "Fulmine persistent volumes are as follows:" && \  kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims fulmine-pvclaim --namespace=fulmine-namespace && \ \ echo "Fulmine persistent volume claims are as follows:" && \  kubectl get storageclasses --all-namespaces && \ \ echo "All storage classes are as follows:" && \  kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces && \ \ echo "All nodes are as follows:" && \  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All pods with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get replicasets --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All replicasets with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All deployments with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get horizontalsepodautoscalers --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All horizontal pod autoscalers with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get services --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All services with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get ingresses --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All ingresses with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get configmaps --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All config maps with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All secrets with node details are as follows:" && \  kubectl get persistentvolumes --all-namespaces -o wide && \  echo "All persistent volumes with node details are as follows:" || true # suppress errors for missing resources or namespaces and continue script execution. ``` This example shows how you can provide detailed instructions on how to run Fulmine in various environments, including locally, in a Docker container, and in a Kubernetes cluster. It also demonstrates how you can provide detailed output for debugging purposes, including pod details, secrets, config maps, persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, storage classes, nodes, and resources in different namespaces. ## Features and Benefits of Fulmine
